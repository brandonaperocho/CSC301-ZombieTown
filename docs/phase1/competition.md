<h2>How is our product different?</h2>
- Innovating on existing features of games of the same genre by adding our own style and creating our own versions of them
- Putting together ideas that are standalone and merging them to form a more complete and well-composed product
- Our product allows the user to customize the front end of the game (texture packs/reskins or objects)
- Has a singleplayer and multiplayer mode
- Friends list and accounts 

<h2>Why our product is better:</h2>
- Our product allows users to customize the textures and skins of the game; most games in this genre do not allow users to do so. This feature gives our product uniqueness. This feature is also very good for those users who get tired very quickly when looking at the same things over and over again. 

- Our product is suitable for all ages 13+. With this said, we cater our game to both, casual gamers and competitive players. The casual gamers are able to play and enjoy our product because of its simplicity and the small amount of time needed to learn and improve at the game. The competitive gamers are able to compete against each other via the global leaderboards. The leaderboard can display their score earned when they finished, and the time they took to beat the game/survived. Time can be measured in 2 ways: How long they survived (the longer the better) or how fast the were able to finish the game (the shorter the better). 

- Most games in this genre are singleplayer. We are going to implement online multiplayer to our product; allowing users to play with their friends over the internet. This allows players to compete against each other at the same time, instead of running 2 different instances of the game and comparing scores/time.

- Our product will have a friends list. Having a friends list allows the user to invite their friends to a multiplayer game without having to ask them over text/phone whether they are online or not.
