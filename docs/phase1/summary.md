<h2>Project Objective</h2>
Create a functional 2D overhead video game that provides its users with an enjoyable and competitive experience. The game will allow the user to take control of the main character, whoâ€™s main objective is to fight for survival while continuously facing newer and more problematic tests. The game will strive to challenge the player with its difficulty in progression, which in turn will promote competitiveness through the use of a global leaderboard that keeps track of the highest scores.

<h2>Key Users</h2>
Our key users are essentially those who have an interest in video games. A problem from this statement is that you can't really narrow down this broad collection of possible users. The users could range widely when it comes down to their type of lifestyle or their age, in addition to other possible factors. A lot of people have the ability to use our project, however, the way in which they use it will vary. Some users will play it as a casual experience to enjoy passing the time, while on the other hand, some users will see it is a competition, allowing them to take the game seriously and strive to get the highest scores against their friends, or against players all around the world.

<h2>Key Scenarios</h2>
- Billy, a university student, is looking for a casual game to play while he takes a break from studying. Billy does not have a top end gaming computer and does not want the game to lag while he plays.	
- Brandon wants to compete against his friend Kal to see who has to wash the dishes for that week. They both play our game and whoever gets the lowest score has to do the dishes for that week. They also agreed that if one of them get onto the top 5 in the global leaderboards then the other must wash the dishes for the rest of the month. 
- Tyler1 is tired of looking at the same textures over and over again so he would like to customize the game with new skins and textures. Tyler1 uploads images he wishes to use into the game directory via game UI. Once Tyler1 is finished, he can click confirm and the game will update the skins/textures to the assigned objects.
- Bob just finished playing, and wishes to post his highscore. Bob follows the instructions given to him, and traverses through the game UI and gets the "Highscores" tab and registers his desired handle, he then clicks "submit" and he now sees that his score has been posted on the global leaderboard. 
- Yiliang is bored of playing singleplayer mode and wishes to play with his friend Zaquari. Before launching the game, Yiliang requests Zaquari to join his lobby session so that they can play in the same game. Once Zaquari has joined, both players click "ready" and the game starts with both of them in it. In that game, they both can see the points they have accumulated over the game. 
	  
<h2>Key Principles</h2>
- Players should have a good experience with playing the game and be able to navigate smoothly though the application
- Developers should be able to easily extend the code by following design patterns 
- Players should be able to change how they want the game to look like (IE colours, object images, skins, etc.)
- Players should be able to log in and log out with a unique username which will be their handle on the leaderboard and a password
