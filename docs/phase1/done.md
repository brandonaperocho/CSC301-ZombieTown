<h2>Standard Done</h2>
- The team has agreed that the project is done when we have a functional zombie game that the player needs to log into and be authenticated inorder to play. Also, the player can easily navaigate around, where mobs spawn and intelligently attack the player and vise versa. The map is generated with different types of terrain that interacts with player/mobs and where users are able to be competative via highscores. The player is able to obtain multiple different weapons that are each unique to the game. The player has free choice on how the controls are setup and accessibility to explore the map to their liking.

<h2>Additional Done</h2>
- Standard Done + addition of bosses, weapons, updated GUI, and multiplayer within the same map. The addition of multiplayer would include things such as having a friends list, lobbies in which the player is teamed up with others online and custom game modes.
