List of Topics Discussed for this Assignment:

There were 3 main topics that were dicussed. 

The first topic that was not chosen was the conceptof a web app that would be similar to Tinder, but only function for UofT. This would be created as a socializing app allowing users to customize their profiles. They could match up with each other and allow messaging between users.

The second topic that was not chosen was the concept of a game. This was our ideal choice, however it was deemed that the 5 week timeframe that we are given would not be sufficient time for the completion of the game that we had in mind. (We wanted to create a game that would function as a 2D Side Scroller)


The topic that we will be choosing for our final project will be a game. That is, it will be a 2D overhead shooting game. The user will have a choice of weapons to use to kill other objects in game. These objects will have some AI and a health bar; once the health bar goes to 0, the user will increase their total score. The game will have a scoreboard to keep track of the score that you accumulate over the levels that you complete. Additionally, once the user has finished playing the game, whether be that he/she quits/loses, their score will be recorded on a global leaderboard. This leaderboard will display the top players who have played the game. This concept can and will be expanded upon, allowing other features to be implemented.

--- OLD IDEA ---
The topic that we will be choosing for our final project will be a website/webapp that will function as a fantasy league for the game "League of Legends". It will allow for the users to have customizable profiles. The main concept will revolve around users creating leagues and competing with other users locally, and globally. Users within leagues will draft their teams, after which their players will get points based on how they play. Users will face each other weekly and standings will be kept of their progress. In addition a global leadboard will be kept. Users will be able to purchase certain items to personalize their profiles and other features. This concept can and will be expanded upon, allowing other features to be implemented.
